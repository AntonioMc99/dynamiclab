This is a little project I built for a lab on DOM manipulation. It’s a dynamic shopping cart where you can add items with a name and price, see them listed out, remove them, and watch the total update in real time. I used basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get everything working. It helped me understand how to create elements with JS, handle user input, and update the page without refreshing. It’s nothing fancy, but it was a good hands-on way to practice how things actually work behind the scenes on a shopping site.
